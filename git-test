I dont really know what my goals as a developer are. I've been asking myself that more and more lately.

This is a big commitment and assuming I complete the program, I'm not sure I even necessary want to be a softward developer.

I suppose I should look into the ways the knowledge from careerdevs opens up my job options in a broader way.
